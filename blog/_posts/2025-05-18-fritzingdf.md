In some corners of the electronics world — particularly forums like •••••.•••••••.cc — Fritzing gets a lot of hate.

I've seen it called
* A useless toy
* As useless as pretty LEGO bricks
* Useless for engineering
* Just pink dots and rat's nests

And yet… I use Fritzing. I like Fritzing. And I’m not here to defend messy diagrams — I’m here to show what Fritzing looks like when used **correctly**

As a Fritzing Part Maker, I spot some bad parts on the web. Maybe that's why some say "Bad for my 'old flower eyes'

## Fritzing's Real Purpose

Fritzing isn’t trying to replace KiCad or EAGLE. It’s trying to bridge the gap between:
* Physical wiring on a breadboard
* Logical connections in a schematic
* And eventually, a printable PCB!

Most haters: They see a bad breadboard and say, "As useless as images!" and can't even get past the forst step!
